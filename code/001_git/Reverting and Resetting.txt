Logging, reverting and resetting 

git log: Logs out all of the commits that have been made within this repo

git log --oneline: displays the same but simplified

git log --oneline --graph: displays graphically

git pull: pulls my changes and updates from my GitHub Repo 

Reverting - Pushing the state of the repo back to a previous commit AND KEEPING the commit history (Undo)

git revert <id> -m "commit message"

Reverting doesn't always work like you expect.. 

Resets are destructive and eliminate previous commits.. These can go wrong and break your repo 
git reset --hard <id>
